\title{Check if \code{x} only contains syntactically valid names}
\usage{
all_names(x, allow_dupl = FALSE, allow_susp = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of names to test.}

\item{allow_dupl}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}: allow duplicate names?}

\item{allow_susp}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}: allow suspicious names?}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} indicating if \code{x} is a character vector that only
contains unique, syntactically valid names.
}
\description{
Check if \code{x} is a character vector that only contains unique, syntactically
valid names that do not suggest they were automatically created or modified.
}
\details{
\link[base:make.names]{Syntactically valid names} are names that (1) only consist
of letters, numbers, dots and underscores; (2) start with a letter or with a
dot not followed by a number; (3) are not \link[=Reserved]{reserved words} such as
\link{for} or any of the \link{NA}s.

Duplicated names, which \emph{are} syntactically valid, are \emph{not} allowed if
argument \code{allow_dupl} is \code{FALSE}. Suspicious names are not allowed if
argument \code{allow_susp} is \code{FALSE}. This function distinguishes two kinds of
suspicious names (see \verb{Programming note 2} for the structure of the regular
expressions used to identify them):
\itemize{
\item Names that might have been created by \code{\link[utils:read.table]{utils::read.csv()}} to name unnamed
columns, either because a particular column was unnamed or because data was
inadvertently present in a supposedly empty (and thus unnamed) column that
was read into \R: column names created by \code{read.csv()} have pattern \code{X},
\code{X.1}, \code{X.2}, \code{...} if \code{header} is \code{TRUE} and pattern \code{V1}, \code{V2}, \code{V3},
\code{...} if \code{header} is \code{FALSE}.
\item Names that might have been modified by
\link[base:make.names]{make.names(..., unique = TRUE)} to make duplicated
names unique: a dot and a number (starting at \code{1} for the first duplicate)
is added to duplicated names to make them unique. This is also used by
read.csv().
}

Invalid names are \emph{not} reported as suspicious names. In addition, duplicated
names are reported only \emph{once} in warnings emitted by \code{all_names()}.
}
\section{Programming note}{
 This implementation is based on the legacy-code of
\code{has_colnames()} and \code{has_names()}, although significant changes have been
made: \code{x} should be the names themselves, not an object to check the names
of; \code{NA} is not allowed for arguments other than \code{x}; argument
\code{allow_duplicated} was shortened to \code{allow_dupl}; arguments \code{check_syntax}
and \code{silently} were removed.
}

\section{Programming note 2}{
 The \link[base:regex]{regular expressions} that are
used to identify suspicious names contain the following elements: (1) require
a pattern to start at the beginning of a string: \code{^}; (2) contain an \code{X} or a
\code{V} followed by a literal dot: \verb{X\\\\.} or \verb{V\\\\.}; (3) contain one or more
digits: \verb{[[:digit:]]+}; (4) require a pattern to reach the end of the string:
\code{$}.

These elements are used to identify suspicious names as: (1) column names
that start with an \code{X} followed by a dot and one or more digits until the end
of the string: \verb{^X\\\\.[[:digit:]]+$}; (2) column names that start with a \code{V}
followed by one or more digits until the end of the string: \verb{^V[[:digit:]]+$};
(3) column names that contain a dot followed by one or more digits until the
end of the string: \verb{\\\\.[[:digit:]]+$}. Indicating the end of the string
prevents matching names that start as suspicious names but are not suspicious
because they have non-digit characters appended, e.g. \code{X.2a}.
}

\section{Programming note 3}{
 Could add argument 'allow_' and pass that to
make.names(), to catch names with underscores?

\examples{
all_names(x = names(c(a = 1, b = 2))) # TRUE

all_names(x = names(c(a = 1, 2))) # FALSE: empty name.
all_names(x = NULL) # FALSE: NULL

all_names(x = c("a", "b", "a")) # FALSE: duplicated name
all_names(x = c("a", "b", "a"), allow_dupl = TRUE) # TRUE

all_names(x = "X.1") # FALSE: name created by read.csv()
all_names(x = "X.1", allow_susp = TRUE) # TRUE

all_names(x = "e.1") # FALSE: name modified by make.names()
all_names(x = "e.1", allow_susp = TRUE) # TRUE
